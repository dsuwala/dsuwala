I'm a recent graduate of the University of Warsaw, Poland with the degree in computational physics. My research interests cover mostly computational chemistry and biology close to the field of drug research.
I am also a c++/python programmer with strong focus on numerical analysis and the developement of equation solvers for different models. Feel free to explore pinned projects.

Personally, I am also linux enthusiast and I was using both arch linux with i3 window manager as well as gentoo with dwm window manager as daily drivers. In free time I also like to go outside for birdwatching, and I reccomend it. It's a great way to be more present especially when you start to hear the different birds in cumulative "park song". Also "Dune" by Frank Herbert fan (currently reading "Childrens of Dune").

I'm a recent graduate of the University of Warsaw, Poland with the degree in computational physics. My research focused on computational physics where I had a taste with
various things: from solid state ground state DFT with spin-orbit correction through solid states excited states simulations with both TD-DFT and BSE methods 
and finally molecular dynamics computational methods. This extensive physics research experience gives me the ability to learn fast and independently aquire necessary knowledge.
I am also a programmer with most experience in numerical analysis and development of solvers for numerical equations.

I am a physicist by education interested by software on low level and for a long term goal I set myself to understand computers from the transistor level through kernel to OS user interface.

Personally, I am also linux enthusiast and I was using both arch linux with i3 window manager as well as gentoo with dwm window manager as daily drivers. In free time I also like to go outside for birdwatching, and I reccomend it. It's a great way to be more present especially when you start to hear the different birds in cumulative "park song". Also "Dune" by Frank Herbert fan (currently reading "Childrens of Dune").

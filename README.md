I'm 1st year Master's at the University of Warsaw, Poland in the field of physics. My interests focus on computational physics where I had a taste with various 
things: from solid state ground state DFT with spin-orbit correction through solid states excited states simulations with both TD-DFT and BSE methods and finally MD 
in which I like the most and I think I will stay there longer. Currently I work at the Institute of Biophysics and Biochemistry in Warsaw with both proteins and 
nucleic acids small-ligands MD which includes also docking before. All of it is done with drug desig in mind. 

In general modern drug design base on creating a ligand which will bind into functional region of a protein or nucleic acid (called in general molecular targets) 
and will stay there blocking target from performing its biological function. Common example is aspirine which blocks enzyme cyclooxigenaze II which is responsible
for triggering inflamation response.

My another huge interests is linux itself. I was using arch as my main OS few months, but I also compiled gentoo and the next on my list is LFS itself (on 
hardware!).
